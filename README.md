# DOOM-style 3D Raycasting Game with AI NPCs

This project is a 3D raycasting game inspired by *Wolfenstein 3D*, created as part of an AI course final project. The game simulates a first-person shooter (FPS) environment with simple 3D rendering using raycasting. The AI NPCs in the game utilize search algorithms (like A* or Dijkstra) to locate and chase the player.

## Features
- **3D Raycasting**: A basic 3D world rendering technique.
- **AI NPCs**: NPCs use search algorithms to find the player.
- **First-Person Shooter (FPS)**: Classic FPS controls.
- **Maze-Like Levels**: The environment consists of maze-like levels where players must navigate.
- **Mouse Control**: Allows the player to look around and navigate the world.
